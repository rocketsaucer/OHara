    <head>A STEP AWAY FROM THEM</head>
    <l n="1">It's my lunch hour, so I go</l>
    <l n="2">for a walk among the hum-colored</l>
    <l n="3">cabs. First, down the sidewalk</l>
    <l n="4">where laborers feed their dirty</l>
    <l n="5">glistening torsos sandwiches</l>
    <l n="6">and Coca-Cola, with yellow helmets</l>
    <l n="7">on. They protect them from falling</l>
    <l n="8">bricks, I guess. Then onto the</l>
    <l n="9">avenue where skirts are flipping</l>
    <l n="10">above heels and blow up over</l>
    <l n="11">grates. The sun is hot, but the</l>
    <l n="12">cabs stir up the air. I look</l>
    <l n="13">at bargains in wristwatches. There</l>
    <l n="14">are cats playing in sawdust.</l>
    <l n="15">On</l>

    <l n="18">the waterfall pours lightly. A</l>
    <l n="19">Negro stands in a doorway with a</l>
    <l n="20">toothpick, languorously agitating.</l>
    <l n="21">A blonde chorus girl clicks: he</l>
    <l n="22">smiles and rubs his chin. Everything</l>
    <l n="23">suddenly honks: it is 12:40 of</l>
    <l n="24">a Thursday.</l>

<head>Sonnet on a Wedding
for Esther and Alfred Leslie</head>

On the glass escarpment of
the city she waits at a streetlamp
in the dawn. Zephyrs ring
her head with curls and a red
balloon, ripe with her <water>tears</water>,
drifts lost in a forest of lightning.

The towers and minarets at
her silky back fall into the blue
as he drives up in a convertible
silent as strings. She clusters
her skirt about her ankles, squats
on her bustle in the rumbling wind.

Her lips are <winter>snowy</winter> and he,
the black bridegroom in bangs,
keeps his eye on the ribbon. But
it's no taxi, and when the copper
sings <quote>"I pr'ounce you one"</quote> her little nose
does hurry sneezing to his cheek,

her fingers perch upon his nape like doves.

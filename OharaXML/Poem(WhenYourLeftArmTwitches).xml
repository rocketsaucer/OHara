<head>Poem</head>

<octave>When your left arm twitches
it's like sunlight on sugar
to me and my tongue seeks
the <water>sea</water> of your skin, its oily
calm of green light on the <earth>floor</earth>
of the <water>ocean</water>
            as in parting,
there's a flutter between us</octave>
<sestet>while I haul down a flag and
you look absently out of
my heart so you won't see
what light one fears in the
sea that I don't want you
to know is of you in me</sestet>

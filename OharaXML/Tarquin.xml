<head>Tarquin</head>

<octave>Exactly at one o'clock your arms broach
the middle of the moon; <water>surf</water> finds its ways
barred by the bold light and a rough loon sways,
bumps in night's ear, a clattering stagecoach.

It is the murmur and the moonstruck ouch!
of love, its glitter in the dark of days
and <water>hurricane</water> of knights' and cowboys' hey!s
on the fragrant plaza, on the hard couch.</octave>

<sestet>The loon resounds like a knock on the door
of the <water>flooded</water> heart, o sweet Roman light
in ribbons over the <earth>prairie</earth>'s collapse!

and the middle of the <water>sea</water> calls on night
to lay her sleeping head upon the <water>shore</water>
and herd the <sky>clouds</sky>, their <earth>mountainous</earth> eclipse.</sestet>

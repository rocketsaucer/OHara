        <head>Aus Einem April</head>

        <octave>We dust the walls.
        And of course we are <water>weeping</water> larks
falling all over the heavens with our shoulders clasped
in someone's armpits, so tightly! and our throats are full.
    Haven't you ever fallen down at <winter>Christmas</winter>
      and didn't it move everyone who saw you?
        isn't that what the tree means? the pure pleasure
  of making <water>weep</water> those whom you cannot move by your flights!</octave>
        <sestet>It's enough to drive one to suicide.
  And the rooftops are falling apart like the applause
  
of rough, long-nailed, intimate, roughened-by-kisses, hands.
Fingers more breathless than a tongue laid upon the lips
in the hour of sunlight, early morning, before the <water>mist</water> rolls
in from the <water>sea</water>; and out there everything is turbulent and green.</sestet>

<octave>The leaves are piled thickly on the green tree
among them squirrels gallop and chuckle
about their emeralds' <water>raindrops</water>; a buckle
like a piece of sun excites them where he

lies drifting in the <earth>grass</earth>. Towards him they prance,
dart, riot towards the lovers down the mast
and o'er the bounding <earth>sod</earth>! and she at last
awakes, wakens him quietly. They dance.</octave>

<sestet><quote>"I love you. Their furry eyes and feathers
are for us riches for a <water>shipwrecked</water> pair,
loving on this <water>seashore</water> this forest's porch."</quote>

<quote>"My hands beneath your skirt don't find weathers,
charts. Should my penis through dangerous air
move up, would you accept it like a torch?"</quote></sestet>

<head>A Sonnet for Jane Freilicher</head>

<octave>Wakening at noon I smelled <sky>airplanes</sky> and <earth>hay</earth>
rang wildly on long distance telephone
ah! what a misery abed alone
alas! what is that click? hurry! hurray!

the <sky>sky</sky> was wheeling under sad and grey
sweet <sky>clouds</sky> but wickedly ne'ertheless shone
outside my lonely coverlets where gone
oh Operator Eighty-one? today</octave>

<sestet>bring me that breath more dear than Fabergé
your secret puissance Operator loan
to pretty Jane whose paintings like a <earth>stone</earth>

are massive true and silently risqué:
<quote>"How closer than Frank to the cosmic bone
comes the bold painting of Fernand Léger"</quote>!</sestet>

<head>Sonnet</head>

Lampooning <winter>blizzards</winter>, how your ocularities
bask at night and drift like sugar in my ears!
Immense plainnesses of smiling, the <sky>sky</sky>
is for once kind and <water>bathing</water>, just as before
the party my mother would towel me upon the tile
and make me <water>cry</water> to stay with her, out of the wind.
Now the <winter>snow</winter> has cuffed a last <water>cry</water> from my cheeks
and festers on my lashes as if they were hands.
They are blue! they are bluer than the dead
and in smiling they roll slightly into cosmic
uneasiness which is based on the infancy of the race;
on that particular event on the <water>shore</water> of Asia Minor
in a gilded canoe when a young queen threw herself
after her crown into the deep for the sheer speed
of a tremendously necessary white departure.

<head>Lines Written in A Raw Youth</head>

<octave>I have the lame dog with me and the <sky>cloud</sky>,
<sky>cirrus</sky> feathering to Europe for spring,
lion at my ear black and gold and loud,
and the brown <water>waves</water> crushing white what they fling.
In a minute the sun will go down and
the wind will sharpen at my throat, its door,
now troubled with breath and raw with brine, sand
in my eyes, at my knees the muscled roar.</octave>
<sestet>Further out my heart's yielding up its food
to <water>fishes</water> hunting <water>coastward</water> with the <water>foam</water>
and as the tents of <water>jellyfish</water> do brood
so brood I on my brutal cold black home.
I plunge again against the pow'rful <water>sea</water>
of my desires and win and force them free.</sestet>

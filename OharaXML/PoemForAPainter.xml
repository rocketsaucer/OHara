<head>Poem for a Painter</head>

<octave>The <winter>ice</winter> of your imagination lends
an anchor to the endless <water>sea</water> of pain,
a harsh cry to the dumb smack who's again
caught in the pitiless <water>tide</water> of hot ends.

Such a trough as I'm in! blind in the <water>rain</water>
the minotaur, hero, struggles. Embrace
engulfs him, and no Muse but the whore. Grace,
you are the flowergirl on the candled plain
</octave>
<sestet>with fingers smelled of turpentine. New Year
be shouted, but not by serious you.
<water>Sea</water> and engine crash on the hapless ear

but your <winter>ice</winter> holds fast, willed art in a nest
of worlds. Hold fast this vessel as your guest,
for fiery spindrift tears me into view.</sestet>
</body>

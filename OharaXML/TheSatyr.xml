<head>The Satyr</head>

<octave>The trees toss and plunge in a skyblue <water>surf</water>!
an automobile comes whizzing, falls by
as the floor of the <water>lake</water> against my thigh
flings needles and leaves like a kiss or scarf

The bend of the <water>shore</water> where my armpits laugh
runs after the cars that drop from my eye
I'll recapture them all before I die
without losing my limbs in the thick <earth>turf</earth></octave>

<sestet>Without fearing the <sky>bluejays</sky> and pine cones
that rob the sun and torment my <winter>cold</winter> face
I'll become the Lover of the quick world

For these threes <water>waves</water> and thieves I'm eager! whirled
and <water>drowned</water> in <water>maelstroms</water> of rhododendrons!
full flowers! round eyes! rush upward! rapture! space!</sestet>

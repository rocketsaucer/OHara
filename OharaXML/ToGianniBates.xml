<head>To Gianni Bates</head>

<octave>Like a piano concerto your black
and white eyes, your white face and bright black hair.
And then, reclining in silence, you're there
with a hall of echoes arching your back
and forcing you to sigh. In me the lack
of sound is merely that I hear your stare.
And when you leave there isn't any air;
though I should stay <sky>aloft</sky>, I have the knack.</octave>
<sestet>But you leave. There isn't any reason
to be silent; in halls the audience
disperses as the instrument's wheeled off
and through jet <water>tears</water> and <water>wet</water> mascara scoff
the year, boring heart-and-concert season.
Too, I've not been silent again, or since.</sestet>

<head>The Pipes of Pan</head>

<octave>A calmness is enforced by moving light
and even more than I can hear or know
first flowers breathed me with their freckled sight
beneath grey grass where I no longer go.
My life was then a <winter>winter</winter> hot with needs,
just then! and now, so careless of its own,
my will relaxes with the fresh green reeds
which spring arrogantly though they're not <earth>sown</earth>.</octave>
<sestet>Indeed, they <sonnetness>want</sonnetness> no wind. They are a <water>lake</water>,
and bend when they wish and do not invite
the sun. They flay the air and do not break;
indifferently they disappear at night,
    and just as calmly <earth>earth</earth>'s of them bereft.
    They found <earth>earth</earth> mute and passionless, and left.</sestet>

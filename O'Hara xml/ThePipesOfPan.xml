<head>The Pipes of Pan</head>

<octave>A calmness is enforced by moving light<l/>
and even more than I can hear or know<l/>
first flowers breathed me with their freckled sight<l/>
beneath grey grass where I no longer go.<l/>
My life was then a <winter>winter</winter> hot with needs,<l/>
just then! and now, so careless of its own,<l/>
my will relaxes with the fresh green reeds<l/>
which spring arrogantly though they're not <earth>sown</earth>.<l/></octave>
<sestet>Indeed, they <sonnetness>want</sonnetness> no wind. They are a <water>lake</water>,<l/>
and bend when they wish and do not invite<l/>
the sun. They flay the air and do not break;<l/>
indifferently they disappear at night,<l/>
    <indent quant="4em"/>and just as calmly <earth>earth</earth>'s of them bereft.<l/>
    <indent quant="4em"/>They found <earth>earth</earth> mute and passionless, and left.<l/></sestet>

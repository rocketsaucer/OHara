<head>The Starving Poet</head>

<octave>I must have leisure, for the leisure bears
me upward on the breasts of art. How high
<sky>flight</sky> soar before true manna feeds the eye!
This is not food, though: I must plunder airs

of choice and find my source, the mirror's there.
Now, with two holidays I paint the <sky>sky</sky>,
an opening in the <sky>clouds</sky> that, thrusting, I
may find a frightened self that's truly fair</octave>

<sestet>and not raped, not fancy and not prelude,
and not woman. The Muse, if such she be
must welcome me herself, not in image,

and strip me boldly my own <sky>heights</sky>. There, see
if I shall not seize the full hours! ravage,
and force their meat upon the multitude.</sestet>

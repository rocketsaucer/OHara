<head>Original Sin</head>

<octave>Dense black trees trapped and bound! the hairy skull
and pushed wildly against the door of <sky>sky</sky>!
the paralyzed flowers, ah! with each eye
shrieking, caught in the web of <sky>stars</sky>, skillful

seiners! in the pitiless <water>sea</water> of will.
Hysterical telegraph <earth>vines</earth> cry to
the vacationing <sky>sky</sky>, monstrous! the blue
mother with her breasts to the wall. The hill</octave>

<sestet>groans in support of them all, saddled! grinds
its great wheels like a <water>riverboat</water>, plunging
and deadly in a smoke of bleeding woods.

Beetles scurry under! ostriches, hinds,
dolphins die in the tumult! the unguent
python waits at the open window, broods.</sestet>

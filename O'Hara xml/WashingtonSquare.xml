<head>Washington Square</head>

<octave>That arch bestrides me, French
victory! the golden staff of the savior

with blue lids. The <soldiers>soldiers</soldiers> filing
at my feet hiss down their drinks

and are savagely decorated, savagely
turned, their gentle feathers torn to medals

in the air. Gold falls upon them, because
there is no love, and it is not the sun.</octave>

<sestet>Jane and Mark <flight>flutter</flight> along the plaza
underneath the fainting gingko trees

and are cheered by pearly uniform horses,
still, at parade rest. The guns ejaculate

into <sky>clouds</sky> abstractedly, and the day
is in danger of passing without wickedness.</sestet>

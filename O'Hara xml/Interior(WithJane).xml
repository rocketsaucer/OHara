be what we are afraid to do

cannot help but move us     Is
this willingness to be a motive

in us what we reject?      The
really stupid things, I mean

a can of coffee, a 35Â¢ ear
ring, a handful of hair, what</octave>

<sestet>do these things do to us?   We
come into the room, the windows

are empty, the sun is weak
and slippery on the <winter>ice</winter>    And a

<water>sob</water> comes, simply because it is
<winter>coldest</winter> of the things we know</sestet>

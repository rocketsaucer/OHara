<head>The Tomb of Arnold Schoenberg</head>

<octave>The <winter>avalanche</winter> drifts to <earth>earth</earth> through giant air
your pure monument's loud windless <winter>blizzard</winter>,
pianoforte of celestial hazard
strangling the swans of peace with arms of hair,

father of sound whose harp's fallen to <earth>earth</earth>
in bitterness and <winter>snows</winter> of savage age.
<winter>Ice</winter> silences your noble eyes, image
of spring, thus my tears your death gives to birth</octave>

<sestet>over Pacific pines and the blue crouch
of the setting <earth>world</earth>. This birth screams in gaze
blind with art's crushing defeat. The dull roar

of incessant <soldiers>soldiers</soldiers> muffles the touch
of spherical music with brutal lays.
I <water>weep</water> upon your bier, this <winter>glacial</winter> <water>shore</water>.</sestet>

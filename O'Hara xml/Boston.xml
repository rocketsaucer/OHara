<octave>These heavy <sky>wings</sky> lurch in a gummy <sky>sky</sky>
on either side of me. And it has been
too shiny all the way, the blinding grin
of <sky>clouds</sky>, the <sky>altitude</sky>'s deafening sigh.

This time I can pick out the buildings my
friends laugh and sulk interestingly in;
with <water>tears</water> of relief I come roaring, thin
and stinging lonely in the <earth>earth</earth>'s flat eye.</octave>

<sestet>Beside the dumpy airport rotting soon
a once-romantic colonial <water>port</water>
the city guards. They run fast on fences

towards me! Another hour and my senses
would have plunged like <sky>Icarus</sky>' foot 'tween sun
and <water>sea</water>. Yet now on <earth>land</earth>, find close consort.</sestet>

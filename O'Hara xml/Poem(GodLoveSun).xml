<octave>God! love! sun! all dear and singular things!
I am not bad although I am wicked
perhaps, and not too rare. Beat, yes, liquored
to exhaustion, dead tired in sheets, still sings

to me the thunderous redwood’s laughings
at my ears, a lover patient and picked,
and the crooning violet’s not panicked
by my bloodshot foreskin, swollen lips, <sky>wings</sky></octave>

<sestet>her tongue stays in my ear and sings. Purple
<sky>clouds</sky>, doubting, say hello across the <earth>lawn</earth>
and linen, wondering if I’m too gay

with exits, too abrupt with doors. Away,
far! the scratchy tune <quote>“L’amant du peuple”</quote>:
I see a girl tap-dancing on the dawn.</sestet>

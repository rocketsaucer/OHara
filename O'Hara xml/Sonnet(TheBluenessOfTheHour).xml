<head>Sonnet</head>

<octave>The blueness of the hour
when the spine stretches itself
into a groan, then the golden cheek
on the dirty pillow, wrinkled by linen.
Odor of lanolin, the flower
pressed between thundering doubts of self,
cleaving fresh air through the week
and loading hearts to the millennium.</octave>
<sestet>Go, sweet breath! come, sweet <water>rain</water>,
bewildering as a tortoise
embracing the Indian <water>ocean</water>,
predictable as a porpoise
    diving upon his mate in cool
    <water>water</water> which is not a <water>pool</water>.</sestet>

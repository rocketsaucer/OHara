<head>After Wyatt</head>

<octave>The night paints inhaling smoke and semen.
    The frail face pulses like a <sky>parachute</sky>,
    corridors of shakes melting from the boot
    of that <water>surf</water> north breathes bloody in simoon.
One the <water>tide</water> when the galleon is moved
    by the fatal dolor of <water>mariners</water>,
    a cry becomes whole night of war in us;
    I'm wrecked on what'ss no grunted green behoved</octave>
<sestet>or truly sufferable. The white will
    and jealousy of death beside the <water>sea</water>
    crushes when not all dark and grievable
like the monster who specks the distance, leers,
    collapses, shouts <quote>"You can die even me,"</quote>
    roaring up, throttles whom he fed for years.</sestet>

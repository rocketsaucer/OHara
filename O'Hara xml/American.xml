<octave>Had you really been wholly mine at night
the fort wouldn't be sneaking its alarms
across the border like a saffron bite
or the tea lady keep nagging <quote>"Love Harms"</quote>

every minute of the day and damn night.
I told you never to mention my arms
to Moors at Headquarters. My dear, be bright,
and never put your dope in candy charms.</octave>

<sestet>Stay away from the soldiers every night,
try to imagine what it's like on farms,
for in pursuing a Chrysler of white
you'll find tears in solution in your arms.

It was not to be so easily charmed
that we sent you to school to be harmed.</sestet>

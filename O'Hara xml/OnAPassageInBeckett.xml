<head>On a Passage in Beckett's Watt &amp; About Geo. Montgomery</head>

<octave>There was someone, my life there at that time,
where I'd read this presence out without doubt
and that piercer would quickly overclimb
from what we'd undergone, so blear without,
and what we'd known was in me of our life
and suddenly had trebled and shook clear
at the words' excessive Keatsness. No knife
glancing off both, in hearts, now, even here.</octave>
<sestet>And can I have unburdened me it was?
where must have borne my life beyond all else
who must have knouted feelings as he does
who knells to crime the peasants with his bells.
    I can't remember. No, all, Sinbad, place,
    of clarity, member, redness, or face.</sestet>

<octave>He'd be wispy in a double feature,
is one transfixed before the naked arm
of a lady shirt maker, sings the psalm
at the supper show night before Easter.

Is in a jam and doesn't know the worth
escapes always and's forever blinded
to the casements there, wrapped behindhand
in railroads and the moony look of <earth>earth</earth>.</octave>

<sestet><quote>"Does it sting of boyish failure?"</quote> or fill
the streets with wilderness and derision?
He's anxiety like a whippoorwill

caught by camera over Canada. Loan
him to rending and wrath, subdivision
of love. It's his international zone.</sestet>

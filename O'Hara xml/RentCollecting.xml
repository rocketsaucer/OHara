<octave>I hate the revolutionary vision, a <water>sea</water> of navels,
for their collapse is a false numb in the blare
of daguerreotypes, a sort of moccasin, nervous,
and now an encrusted infiltration. She's mild
for the rancid tenebrae, he for her blind
mariposa, the villain courses the count
and fiery grunt infuses <sneeze>sneezes</sneeze> into the mob
of squatting Pernambucoites, beside the rock.</octave>
<sestet>It is significantly to be pierced noisily
by the misfortunates of hasy arrows
and to shunt some, that the belly distends
into blowing lies of <sky>cloud</sky>, and the world narrows.
Not quite comparatively, as an Old World is stifled
by a giant hardon, the taverners are loose.</sestet>

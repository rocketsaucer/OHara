<head>A Quiet Poem</head>
       
<octave>When music is far enough away
the eyelid does not often move

and objects are still as lavender
without breath or distant rejoinder.

The <sky>cloud</sky> is then so subtly dragged
away by the silver <sky>flying</sky> machine

that the thought of it alone echoes
unbelievably; the sound of the motor falls</octave>

<sestet>like a coin toward the <water>ocean</water>'s floor
and the eye does not flicker

as it does when in the loud sun a coin
rises and nicks the near air. Now,

slowly, the heart breathes to music
while the coins lie in <water>wet</water> yellow sand.</sestet>

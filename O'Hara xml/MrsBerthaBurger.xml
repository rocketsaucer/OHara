<head>Mrs Bertha Burger</head>

<octave>A widow. She has lived so many lives
and each is like an ember glowing now.
On days of darkness like so many knives
she feels each fullness press her breast and brow.
Each life, protected, prized and coveted
and thought through for the wisdom of events
she sees again as she is buffeted:
delicate <water>ships</water> know well their own torments,</octave>
<sestet>and she knows well the dignity of <water>storms</water>.
She offers in a chance remark her fate
and her reflections are not flights or calms.
Her life is beautiful, and free from hate;
    to know her is to know how rarely one
    may love, as one again beholds the sun.</sestet>

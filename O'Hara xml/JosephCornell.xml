detailed disaster the violet
light pours. It's not a <sky>sky</sky>
it's a room. And in the open
field a glass of absinthe is
fluttering its song of Inida.
Prairie winds circle mosques.

<sestet>young to understand. He is
bored with his sense of the
past, the artist. Out of the
prescient rock in his heart
he has spread a <earth>land</earth> without
flowers of near distances.</sestet>

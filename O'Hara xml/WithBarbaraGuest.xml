<head>With Barbara Guest in Paris</head>

<octave>Oh Barbara! do you think
they’ll ever name anything after us like
rue Henri-Barbusse or
canard a l’ouragan?

have infected a pale white
moonish bateau-frigidaire
with our melancholy lights
and vaguely proud dissemblings?
</octave>
<sestet>
    care for the lap of Mallarmé
and the place where heroes fell down
is right in our Pushkinesque enclosure
as greatness sleeps outside
                        smiles and bears
                        the purple city air</sestet>

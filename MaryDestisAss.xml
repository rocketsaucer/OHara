<head>MARY DESTI’S ASS</head>

In <placeName ref="#Bayreuth">Bayreuth</placeName> once
we were very good friends of the Wagners
and I stepped in once
for Isadora so perfectly
she would never allow me to dance again
that’s the way it was in <placeName ref="#Bayreuth">Bayreuth</placeName>

the way it was in <placeName ref="#Hackensack_NJ">Hackensack</placeName>
was different
there one never did anything
and everyone hated you anyway
it was fun, it was clear
you knew where you stood

in <placeName ref="#Boston_MA">Boston</placeName> you were never really standing
I was usually lying
it was amusing to be lying all
the time for everybody
it was like exercise

it means something to exercise
in <placeName ref="#Norfolk_Virginia">Norfolk Virginia</placeName>
it means you’ve been to bed with a Nigra
well it is exercise
the only difference is it’s better than <placeName ref="#Boston_MA">Boston</placeName>

I was walking along the street
of <placeName ref="#Cincinnati_OH">Cincinnati</placeName>
and I met <persName ref="#Koch_Kenneth">Kenneth Koch</persName>’s mother
fresh from the Istanbul Hilton
she liked me and I liked her
we both liked Istanbul

then in Waukegan I met a furniture manufacturer
and it wiped out all dreams of pleasantness
from my mind
it was like being pushed down hard
on a chair
it was like something horrible you hadn’t expected
which is the most horrible thing

and in <placeName ref="#Singapore">Singapore</placeName> I got a dreadful
disease it was amusing to have bumps
except they went into my veins
and rose to the surface like Vesuvius
getting cured was like learning to smoke

yet I always loved Baltimore
the porches which hurt your ass
no, they were the steps
well you have a wet ass anyway
if they’d only stop scrubbing

and Frisco where I saw
<persName ref="#Toumanova_Tamara">Toumanova</persName> “the baby ballerina” except
she looked like a cow
I didn’t know the history of the ballet yet
not that that taught me much

now if you feel like you want to deal with
Tokyo
you’ve really got something to handle
it’s like Times Square at midnight
you don’t know where you’re going
but you know

and then in Harbin I knew
how to behave it was glorious that
was love sneaking up on me through the snow
and I felt it was because of all
the postcards and the smiles and kisses and the grunts
that was love but I kept on traveling
